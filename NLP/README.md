# Crypto Natural Language Processing

In this homework we pulled news headlines related to Bitcoin and Ethereum and performed
the various kinds of sentiment analysis that we learned over the last week in class. Overall the sentiment is very high but that is probably due to being at the top of the most recent rally. 

In this project I employed the various techniques required by the assignment to parse grammars, stopwords, lemmas (root words), ngrams, and named entity recognition. The results for bitcoin and ethereum showed that elon musk and tesla are highly related to
cryptos in recent times. This is due to tesla buying a huge amount of bitcoin so they can start accepting payments in bitcoin. Seeing 'all time high' in the word cloud for bitcoin would signal a strong sell in my opinion but to each their own. Another observation is that we can see New York in the ethereum word cloud. This is because of Tether's lawsuit and the pumpamentals of ponzi currency in the ecosystem.
